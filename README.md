# dnd-stats-generator
A project to randomly generate RPG characters stats and to study code design with Java and Spring.

## What it does?
You can request character stats (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma) choosing one creation method:
- Classic: Stats come from rolling 3d6. That's it.
- Standard: Roll 4d6 and drop the lowest d6.
- Epic: Roll 4d6, reroll any 1s, and drop the lowest.

## Design Patterns implemented
- Strategy
- Chain of Responsibility
